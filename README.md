# What should I...?

A personalized recommendation tool built with JavaScript.

## About this project

**Your domain:** Music

**Your question:** What should I listen to?

**Description:** The reccomendation tool helps users decide what they should listen to depending on what they're doing, how they're feeling, what genre they'd like, and how long they have to listen to a song.

## How it works

1. User selects preferences from the form
2. Matching functions filter the data based on preferences
3. Recommendations are displayed on the page
