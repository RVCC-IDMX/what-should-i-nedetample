## Data creation

### What I asked AI to help with

I asked AI about what categories I could use for songs and had it generate me 15 song examples.

### What I verified or changed

I had to correct AI's guesses for how many seconds long the songs were, and I also changed the activities it assigned to songs because I didn't agree with all of them.

## Matching functions

### Functions I wrote with AI assistance

| Function name | What it does        | How AI helped              |
| ------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| [name]        | [brief description] | [generated/refined/edited] |

### Code I had to fix or adjust

I had no issues I had to fix.

## Reflection

### What worked well

I found that being direct and detailed with what exactly I wanted the AI to do worked well. This way it would make as little errors as possible, especially when generating code.

### What was challenging

I had to work more independentyl when filling in the categories for the songs. Since AI doesn't think like me, a lot of what it generated was not what I had in mind, so I had to change a lot of them.

### What I learned

I learned more about whwat a good prompt for AI looks like and when to use it if I'm confused versus when to figure something out on my own.
